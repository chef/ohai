## Description

Ohai detects data about your operating system. It can be used standalone, but its primary purpose is to provide node data to Chef.

Ohai will print out a JSON data blob for all the known data about your system. When used with Chef, that data is reported back via node attributes.

Chef distributes ohai as a RubyGem. This README is for developers who want to modify the Ohai source code. For users who want to write plugins for Ohai, see the docs:

- General documentation: <https://docs.chef.io/ohai/>
- Writing Ohai Plugins documentation: <https://docs.chef.io/ohai_custom/>

## Development Environment

Ohai's development dependencies should be installed with bundler. Just run `bundle install` in the root of the repo.

## Spec Testing

We use RSpec for unit/spec tests. To run the full suite, run:

```
bundle exec rake spec
```

You can run individual test files by running the rspec executable:

```
bundle exec rspec spec/unit/FILE.rb
```

## Style

We use [Chefstyle](https://github.com/chef/chefstyle), as a code [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)), to enforce style guidelines. To run:

```
bundle exec rake style
```

You can run and automatically correct the issues:

```
bundle exec rake style:auto_correct
```

## Rake Tasks

Ohai has some Rake tasks for doing various things.

```
bundle exec rake -T
rake build               # Build ohai-$VERSION.gem into the pkg directory
rake clean               # Remove any temporary products
rake clobber             # Remove any generated files
rake install             # Build and install ohai-$VERSION.gem into system gems
rake install:local       # Build and install ohai-$VERSION.gem into system gems without network access
rake release[remote]     # Create tag $VERSION and build and push ohai-$VERSION.gem to rubygems.org
rake spec                # Run RSpec code examples
rake style               # Run Chefstyle tests
rake style:auto_correct  # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses

($VERSION is the current version, from the GemSpec in Rakefile)
```
