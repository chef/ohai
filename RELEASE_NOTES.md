# UNRELEASED

## Multiple plugin directories

You can now specify more than one directory to load additional Ohai plugins from by using the `--directory` / `-d` flag more than once.

Example:
```bash
ohai -d /path/to/more/plugins -d /another/path/to/more/plugins
```

# Ohai Release Notes 14.3

## Detection of Amazon Linux 2.0

Ohai now properly detects the platform_version of the final release of Amazon Linux 2.0 in addition to the previous detection of the RC platform_version.

# Ohai Release Notes 14.2

## Virtualization detection on AWS

Ohai now detects the virtualization hypervisor `amazonec2` when running on Amazon's new C5/M5 instances.

# Ohai Release Notes 14.1

## Configurable DMI Whitelist

The whitelist of DMI IDs is now user configurable using the `additional_dmi_ids` configuration setting, which takes an Array.

## Shard plugin

The Shard plugin has been returned to a default plugin rather than an optional one. To ensure we work in FIPS environments, the plugin will use SHA256 rather than MD5 in those environments.

## SCSI plugin

A new plugin to enumerate SCSI devices has been added. This plugin is optional.

# Ohai Release Notes 14.0

## Windows Kernel information

The kernel plugin now reports the following information on Windows:

- `node['kernel']['product_type']` - Workstation vs. Server editions of Windows
- `node['kernel']['system_type']` - What kind of hardware are we installed on (Desktop, Mobile, Workstation, Enterprise Server, etc.)
- `node['kernel']['server_core']` - Are we on Windows Server Core edition?

## Cloud Detection

Ohai now detects the Scaleway cloud and provides additional configuration information for systems running on Azure.

## Virtualization / Container Detection

In addition to detecting if a system is a Docker host, we now provide a large amount of Docker configuration information available at `node['docker']`. This includes the release of Docker, installed plugins, network config, and the number of running containers.

Ohai also now properly detects LXD containers and macOS guests running on VirtualBox / VMware. This data is available in `node['virtualization']['systems']`

## Optional Ohai Plugins

Ohai now includes the ability to mark plugins as optional, which skips those plugins by default. This allows us to ship additional plugins, which some users may find useful, but not all users would want being written to their Chef server. The change introduces two new configuration options; `run_all_plugins` which runs everything including optional plugins, and `optional_plugins` which allows you to run plugins marked as optional.

By default we will now be marking the `lspci`, `sessions` and `passwd` plugins as optional. Passwd has been particularly problematic for nodes attached LDAP or AD where it attempts to write the entire directory to the node. If you previously disabled this plugin via Ohai config, you no longer need to. Hurray!

## Logging Improvements

Chef and Ohai now includes a new log level of `:trace` in addition to the existing `:info`, `:warn`, and `:debug` levels. With the introduction of `trace` level logging we've moved a large amount of logging that more useful for developers from `debug` to `trace`. If you want a complete insight into what is going on internally in Ohai run -l trace not -l debug.

## Breaking Changes

### cloud_v2 and filesystem2 Plugins

In Chef 13 the `cloud_v2` plugin replaced data at `node['cloud']` and `filesystem2` replaced data at `node['filesystem']`. For compatibility with cookbooks that were previously using the "v2" data we continued to write data to both locations (ie: both node['filesystem'] and node['filesystem2']). We now no longer write data to the "v2" locations which greatly reduces the amount of data we need to store on the Chef server.

### Ipscopes Plugin Removed

The ipscopes plugin has been removed as it duplicated data already present in the network plugins and required the user to install an additional gem into the Chef installation.

### libvirt attributes moved

The libvirt Ohai plugin now writes data to `node['libvirt']` instead of writing to various locations in `node['virtualization']`. This plugin required installing an additional gem into the Chef installation and thus was infrequently used.

### Ohai Plugin V6 Support Removed

In 2014 we introduced Ohai v7 with a greatly improved plugin format. With Chef 14 we no longer support loading of the legacy "v6" plugin format.

### Newly-disabled Ohai Plugins

As mentioned above we now support an `optional` flag for Ohai plugins and have marked the `sessions`, `lspci`, and `passwd` plugins as optional, which disables them by default. If you need one of these plugins you can include them using `optional_plugins`.

optional_plugins in the client.rb file:

```ruby
optional_plugins [ "lspci", "passwd" ]
```

# Ohai Release Notes 13.8.0

## Softlayer metadata polling fixed

We now use TLS 1.2 for polling Softlayer metadata since 1.0/1.1 were disabled on 3/1/2018

# Ohai Release Notes 13.7.1

## Network Tunnel Information

The Network plugin on Linux hosts now gathers additional information on tunnels

## LsPci Plugin

The new LsPci plugin provides a `node[:pci]` hash with information about the PCI bus based on `lspci`. Only runs on Linux.

# Ohai Release Notes 13.7

## EC2 C5 Detection

The EC2 plugin has been updated to properly detect the new AWS hypervisor used in the C5 instance types

## mdadm

The mdadm plugin has been updated to properly handle arrays with more than 10 disks and to properly handle journal and spare drives in the disk counts

# Ohai Release Notes 13.6

## Critical Plugins

Users can now specify a list of plugins which are `critical`. Critical plugins will cause Ohai to fail if they do not run successfully (and thus cause a Chef run using Ohai to fail). The syntax for this is:

```
ohai.critical_plugins << :Filesystem
```

## Filesystem now has a `allow_partial_data` configuration option

The Filesystem plugin now has a `allow_partial_data` configuration option. If set, the filesystem will return whatever data it can even if some commands it ran failed.

## Rackspace detection on Windows

Windows nodes running on Rackspace will now properly detect themselves as running on Rackspace without a hint file.

## Package data on Amazon Linux

The Packages plugin now supports gathering packages data on Amazon Linux

## Deprecation updates

In Ohai 13 we replaced the filesystem and cloud plugins with the filesystem2 and cloud_v2 plugins. To maintain compatibility with users of the previous V2 plugins we write data to both locations. We had originally planned to continue writing data to both locations until Chef 15\. Instead due to the large amount of duplicate node data this introduces we are updating OHAI-11 and OHAI-12 deprecations to remove node['cloud_v2'] and node['filesystem2'] with the release of Chef 14 in April 2018.

# Ohai Release Notes 13.5

## Correctly detect IPv6 routes ending in ::

Previously we would ignore routes that ended `::`, and now we properly detect them.

## Plugin run time is now measured

Debug logs will show the length of time each plugin takes to run, making debugging of long ohai runs easier.

# Ohai Release Notes 13.4

## Windows EC2 Detection

Detection of nodes running in EC2 has been greatly improved and should now detect nodes 100% of the time including nodes that have been migrated to EC2 or were built with custom AMIs.

## Azure Metadata Endpoint Detection

Ohai now polls the new Azure metadata endpoint, giving us additional configuration details on nodes running in Azure

# Ohai Release Notes 13.2:

Ohai 13.2 has been a fantastic release in terms of community involvement with new plugins, platform support, and critical bug fixes coming from community members. A huge thank you to msgarbossa, albertomurillo, jaymzh, and davide125 for their work.

## New Features

### Systemd Paths Plugin

#### Clear Linux

- platform: clearlinux
- platform_family: clearlinux

## New Deprecations

### Removal of IpScopes plugin. (OHAI-13)

<https://docs.chef.io/deprecations_ohai_ipscopes.html>

In Chef/Ohai 14 (April 2018) we will remove the IpScopes plugin. The data returned by this plugin is nearly identical to information already returned by individual network plugins and this plugin required the installation of an additional gem into the Chef installation. We believe that few users were installing the gem and users would be better served by the data returned from the network plugins.
