# Ohai Release Notes 13.2:

Ohai 13.2 has been a fantastic release in terms of community involvement with new plugins, platform support, and critical bug fixes coming from community members. A huge thank you to msgarbossa, albertomurillo, jaymzh, and davide125 for their work.

## New Features

### Systemd Paths Plugin

A new plugin has been added to expose system and user paths from systemd-path (see <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-path.html> for details).

### Linux Network, Filesystem, and Mdadm Plugin Resilience

The Network, Filesystem, and Mdadm plugins have been improved to greatly reduce failures to collect data. The Network plugin now better finds the binaries it requires for shelling out, filesystem plugin utilizes data from multiple sources, and mdadm handles arrays in bad states.

### Zpool Plugin Platform Expansion

The Zpool plugin has been updated to support BSD and Linux in addition to Solaris.

### RPM version parsing on AIX

The packages plugin now correctly parses RPM package name / version information on AIX systems.

### Additional Platform Support

Ohai now properly detects the [Clear](https://clearlinux.org/) and [ClearOS](https://www.clearos.com/) Linux distributions.

#### Clear Linux

- platform: clearlinux
- platform_family: clearlinux

#### ClearOS

- platform: clearos
- platform_family: rhel

## New Deprecations

### Removal of IpScopes plugin. (OHAI-13)

<https://docs.chef.io/deprecations_ohai_ipscopes.html>

In Chef/Ohai 14 (April 2018) we will remove the IpScopes plugin. The data returned by this plugin is nearly identical to information already returned by individual network plugins and this plugin required the installation of an additional gem into the Chef installation. We believe that few users were installing the gem and users would be better served by the data returned from the network plugins.
