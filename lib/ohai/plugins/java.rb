  # On Mac OS X, the development tools include "stubs" for JVM executables that
  # prompt the user to install the JVM if they desire. In our case we simply
  # wish to detect if the JVM is there and do not want to trigger a popup
  # window. As a workaround, we can run the java_home executable and check its
  # exit status to determine if the `java` executable is the real one or the OS
  # X stub. In the terminal, it looks like this:
  #
  #   $ /usr/libexec/java_home
  #   Unable to find any JVMs matching version "(null)".
  #   No Java runtime present, try --request to install.
  #
  #   $ echo $?
  #   1
  #
  # This check always returns true when not on darwin because it is just a
  # workaround for this particular annoyance.
