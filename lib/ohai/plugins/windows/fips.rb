# After long discussion in IRC the "powers that be" have come to a concensus
# that there is no other Windows platforms exist that were not based on the
# Windows_NT kernel, so we herby decree that "windows" will refer to all
# platforms built upon the Windows_NT kernel and have access to win32 or win64
# subsystems.
